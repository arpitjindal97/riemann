      <h2>Ask around</h2>

      <p>If you've got a personal inquiry, or just want to say thanks, feel
      free to email me directly. But if you need help with Riemann, please ask
      via IRC, the mailing list, or via Github Issues. You'll have a better
      chance of finding someone who can answer your question, and there'll be a
      record that other people with similar problems can read later.</p>

      <h2>Pay it forward</h2>

      <p>Riemann is a volunteer effort, and I need your help to make it happen!
      Join the IRC channel and mailing list. Use your experience to improve
      rough spots in the documentation. Help make newcomers feel welcome.
      Answer whatever questions you can. We're all in this together!</p>
